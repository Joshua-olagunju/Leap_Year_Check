## Leap Year Checker 🗓️
This is a simple Python script that checks whether a given year is a leap year or not. It provides a user-friendly experience by adding a short delay before displaying the result.

## How It Works
✅ The script asks the user to enter a year.
✅ It checks if the year is a leap year using the standard leap year formula.
✅ It displays the result after a 2-second delay for better interaction.

## Usage
Run the script in a Python environment:
```
python3 Leap_Year_Check.py
```
Enter any year when prompted.
The script will confirm and return whether it is a Leap Year or Not a Leap Year.

## Example Output
```
Welcome to the script, this helps you
check if any year is a leap year or not
Enter a year: 2024
Please wait!!! We are confirming.
Thank you for using this service
2024 is a Leap Year
